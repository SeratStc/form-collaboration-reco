## Dependencies

* Use bower.js instead of manually downloaded libraries in client/lib
* Upgrade to knockout.js version 3
* Consider using a collaboration framework? E.g., sails.js, meteor.js, derby.js (but there are many others!). And/or use an operational transform library, see Koren (2013)  "Shared editing on the web: A classification of developer support libraries".




## Bugs

* "dynamic dom" notifications do not work with input types other than text areas. 
* Document and fix numerous styling issues



## Configuration options

* Restructure and rename the configuration options to better match Johannes' manuscript.
